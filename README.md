This repository demonstrates a common error in Perl: accessing an array element outside its defined bounds. The 'bug.pl' file contains the erroneous code, while 'bugSolution.pl' provides a corrected version with error handling.  The issue arises from attempting to access an element beyond the array's size, which is undefined behavior in Perl.  The solution demonstrates how to check for valid array indices before attempting access to prevent the error.
